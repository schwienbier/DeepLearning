# DeepLearning
This repository contains Python code for deep learning models. The code is in notebooks. Each notebook has a detailed description as follows.

- gan_face2sketch.ipynb
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was developed to transform pixel images into pencil sketches.

- gan_generate_music.ipynb
A GAN was trained to generate music with 100 notes.

- gan_generate_non_existing_faces.ipynb
A GAN was trained to generate non-existing faces.

- gan_generate_pokeball.ipynb
A GAN was trained to generate pokeballs.

- gpt2.ipynb
A pretrained GPT2 learns to answer questions in a funny way.
